# Chapter 4: First App Deployment with ArgoCD

In this chapter, we will learn how to deploy applications with ArgoCD using **three different approaches**:  

1. **UI Approach** → NGINX example  
2. **CLI Approach** → Apache example  
3. **Declarative Approach** → Online Shop example  

Each method has its use cases, but only the **Declarative approach** aligns with the principles of GitOps.
