# ArgoCD-for-DevOps/SREs

This repository is my **end-to-end ArgoCD learning, implementation, and practice**.  
It is structured for engineers who prefer **practical clarity, production-aligned workflows, and reproducible GitOps setups** over theory.

Every chapter reflects how I approach ArgoCD as a DevOps/SRE engineer —  
**clean structure, predictable flows, and industry-grade configurations.**
